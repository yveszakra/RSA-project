# RSA-project
The main goal for our project is to demonstrate our understanding of RSA. We are analyzing the resistance of RSA to cryptanalytic attacks. Our implementation of the RSA program is written in C++. The program consists of finding two large (at least 100 digits) prime numbers p and q to generate the modulus for RSA. Those prime numbers are verified before being used in the necessary computations. Once this is done, we proceed with the encryption of a message contained in a text file. After the message is encrypted, the decryption of the cypher text follows. Thus, the implementation of the RSA is completed.
